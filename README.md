Title
Object Detection and Story Generation Using YOLOv8 and Transformer

Abstract
This project aims to develop a system that captures objects in images using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) model and generates coherent stories based on the detected objects using transformers. The integration of these technologies provides a robust framework for creating narrative descriptions from visual inputs. The system includes interactive features, allowing users to influence the story by manipulating the objects in the scene.

Introduction
With advancements in computer vision and natural language processing, it is now possible to create systems that understand visual scenes and generate descriptive texts. This project leverages the YOLOv8 model for object detection and transformers networks for story generation. The primary goal is to automatically generate meaningful stories from images by identifying the objects within and constructing a narrative around them. The system also supports interactive user experiences, where users can influence the story by placing different objects in the scene.


Objectives
- To detect objects in images using the YOLOv8 model.
- To generate coherent stories based on the detected objects using transformers networks.
- To create an interactive experience where users can influence the narrative by manipulating objects.
- To evaluate the performance and coherence of the generated stories.


Methodology

1. Image Data Collection
- Collection: Gather a diverse set of images to ensure a wide range of objects and scenes.
- Annotation: Annotate the images to create a dataset suitable for training and evaluating the object detection model.

2. Object Detection with YOLOv8
- YOLOv8 Overview: YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection model that identifies and classifies objects within images with high speed and accuracy.
- Implementation: Utilize the pre-trained YOLOv8 model to detect objects in given images. The model will provide the class labels and bounding boxes for each detected object.
- Data Preparation: Fine-tune the YOLOv8 model on the annotated dataset if necessary to improve detection accuracy.


3. Listing Identified Objects
- Process: List down all objects identified by the YOLOv8 model from the input images.
- Database: Maintain a database of objects with various levels of detail for reference and storytelling purposes.    

4. Building a Storytelling Model
- Transformers Overview: Unlike traditional RNNs, transformers rely on an attention mechanism to understand the relationships between different parts of a text sequence. This allows them to analyze all parts of the sequence simultaneously, which is efficient for capturing long-range dependencies.
Implementation: Develop a transformers network trained on a dataset of images and corresponding textual descriptions. The network will learn to generate narratives based on sequences of detected objects.
- Data Preparation: Curate a dataset containing images and their corresponding descriptive stories. Preprocess the textual data to create sequences that can be used to train the Transformers network.


5. Story Generation and Interactive Experience
- Pipeline: Combine the YOLOv8 object detection outputs with the transformer network. The detected objects will serve as input to the transformer, which will generate a story based on these objects.
- Algorithm:
  1. Input an image to the YOLOv8 model.
  2. Detect objects and extract their labels and positions.
  3. Feed the sequence of object labels into the transformer network.
  4. Generate and output a coherent story based on the object sequence.
- Interactive Features:
  - Users can influence the story by placing different objects.
  - The order and combination of objects can lead to unique narrative twists or unlock hidden parts of the story. 
  - The system can provide prompts or hints to guide users and encourage exploration with various objects.
  Output 

Applications
- Museums and Exhibitions: Create interactive displays where objects become part of the storytelling experience.
- Educational Apps: Make learning about history or literature more engaging by integrating object-based storytelling.
- Home Use: Spark creativity and encourage children to use everyday objects for storytelling.


Results
- Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the performance of the YOLOv8 model using metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP). Evaluate the Transformers-generated stories using BLEU scores and human judgment for coherence and relevance.
- Expected Outcomes: Demonstrate the systemâ€™s ability to accurately detect objects and generate meaningful stories. Highlight any limitations and propose areas for improvement.

Conclusion
This project showcases a novel application of combining state-of-the-art object detection with advanced natural language processing techniques to generate stories from images. The interactive features add a layer of engagement, allowing users to influence the narrative. The results will provide insights into the potential and challenges of such integrative approaches in artificial intelligence.

Future Work
- Improve the story generation model by incorporating more sophisticated language models such as GPT or BERT.
- Explore the use of additional contextual information (e.g., object relationships, actions) to enhance story coherence.
- Expand the dataset to include a wider variety of scenes and objects for more robust model training and evaluation.
